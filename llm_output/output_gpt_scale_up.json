The low rating of 2 stars further emphasizes the dissatisfaction. This negative perspective deviates from the overall positive tone of the other reviews.\n- review5: While the review acknowledges that the food is not bad, the overall impression is that the restaurant is overpriced and not impressive enough to warrant a return visit. This contrasts with the other reviews that express high satisfaction and praise for the food and overall experience.\n- review7: This review highlights the high price of an omelette and flavored coffee, expressing surprise and dissatisfaction. The focus on the expensive nature of the items deviates from the typical criteria used in restaurant reviews, making it an outlier.",
