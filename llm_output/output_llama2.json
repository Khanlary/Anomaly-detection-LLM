The reviewer's unusual perspective and positive rating make it an outlier.\n3. Review 7: This review is an outlier because it doesn't provide a personal experience of staying at the hotel. Instead, it offers advice on finding alternative accommodations. The lack of direct commentary about the hotel's features or services, and focusing solely on price comparison, makes it an outlier.\n4.
