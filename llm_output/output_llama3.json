Review 1: This review stands out because it gives a perfect 5-star rating and describes the hotel as the \"nicest experience\" the reviewer has had in downtown Chicago. The reviewer also mentions that the service, rooms, and bathrooms were \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous,\" which suggests a high level of quality and comfort. This review is an outlier because it deviates from the norm of reviews that mention negative aspects or provide a more balanced assessment of the hotel's features.\n2. Review 8: This review is an outlier because it does not provide a personal experience of staying at the hotel. Instead, it offers advice on finding alternative accommodations and compares prices. This review does not provide any information about the hotel's amenities, service, or quality, which makes it unusual compared to other reviews.\n\nThe confidence level for these outliers is medium to high, as they deviate significantly from the norm of the other reviews. The reasons for their outlier status are due to their unusual content and focus,",

The reviewer mentions several positive aspects of the hotel, but also describes a negative interaction with a staff member. This inconsistency makes the review stand out from other reviews that typically focus on either positive or negative aspects of the hotel.\n* Review 2: The review is an outlier because it describes a very negative experience with the hotel's staff, which is not typical of reviews for the Westin Michigan Avenue. Most reviews for this hotel mention positive experiences with the staff, making this review an outlier. Additionally, the reviewer's comment about the hotel's management being unhelpful and unresponsive is also unusual, as most reviews do",

The reviewer's positive spin on these negative aspects is inconsistent with the norm, making this review an outlier.\n2.
