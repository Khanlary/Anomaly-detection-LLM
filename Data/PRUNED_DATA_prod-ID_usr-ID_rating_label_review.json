Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip.

There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And...

The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool.

They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit.

Our room was clean and in the morning I saw several housekeeping employees starting on the rooms so that told me they have adequate staff to keep the motel looking its best. It's on the city's north side, not far from Andersonville. The Clark and Ridge location puts you convenient to many popular north side eateries, shops and of course, Wrigley Field. CONS It can be a bit noisy, especially if you're not used to \"city noise\". Parking. While they do have a private lot, there is an equal number of spots per room, which means if two cars of customers are staying in one room, two spaces are used. We saw cars blocked in (ours included) in the morning due to this. The bathroom is pretty small and the shower curtain was a bi-fold style, made of hard plastic that, when closed, made the small shower area even more cramped.

Common Area defects - Hallways are hot - not air conditioned, elevators are slow, call lights are not lighted, 2nd elevator from parking garage in disrepair, no security and direct access from street outside to hotel floorspace using elevator 2, not enough parking available. Cosmetic - room dcor is combination 70s and 80s. It's not timeless - just old. The bathroom finish materials are plastic and cheap and look terrible. Pluses - staff is working with a failing albatross, yet maintains a positive attitude toward guests - for the most part, housekeeping is doing a herculean job to keep bedding and towels and rooms in clean condition - for the most part. Negatives - staff management protocol near full booking is to re-sell a reserved room at 4 pm. I learned at 6:30 p.m. that my credit card reserved room was given away 2 1/2 hours earlier at 4 p.m. while I was in a jet flying to Chicago - amazing poor customer relations on this item.

I've never heard of releasing a room at the very moment it becomes available for occupancy...The second night, they switched me to room #2 which had A/C but no working toilet. Oh well, they tried, I guess. Overall conclusion: Do whatever you can to stay elsewhere. This hotel is broken. However, if you are an intrepid type and you don't mind hardships like heat and no working toilet, and if you are pressed for a room because there are no other vacancies within 30 miles, it is possible to sleep here and shower here - there is minimal but sufficient comfort to accomplish that due to the decent housekeeping.

It hadnt looked like the carpet ahd been vacuumed in months. There was a cigarette butt on the step. We paid 52$ for a private room, a single room means you pay 34$, but have to share a bathroom with your neighbor. Who the F@@@ wants to do that.This room was amaller than an efficiency apartment. There were missing tiles in the showers. It was dirty, filthy, and disgusting. The ceiling had a huge crack in it, with rust and paint chipping. There were two roaches in the drawers of the dresser. As i pulled back back the sheets to check them out, I saw cigarette burn holes and stains. THe plate that held a big cup for ice and plastic cups had cigarette burns on it also.The windows had paint chipping on them as well, with graffitti spray painted on two windows.This was the worst hotel I've ever seen. We did not stay the night. We wasted 52$ on some pig stye room. As we left I got the managers business card. i agree with a past review, this place is for hookers ands junkies.....and bums.....Really creepy atmosphere.I've stayed at the Dollar Inn before, and compared to this place, the Dollar Inn is a Hilton. I don't understand how the Health Department hasn't been called on them. It is not sanitary whatsoever, how can a business be ran in the condition of this measure of nastiness.........I could go on and on about all the horrible things of this hotel, but i think ive said enough.Oh and I had to rate this hotel with at least one star, but it, in no way, deserves even one star......no stars for this place!!!!!!!

They presume you will know what they are, which I didn't; and notwithstanding that they spoke reasonably good English, the communication barrier made it too difficult to get satisfactory explanations of what each menu item was.So in the end I basically pointed at two items on the menu and said \"bring me that and that.\" Lucky for me, they turned out to be very good choices.

It was unfortunate they all ran out so quickly but I had a good time nonetheless. However, the evening ended on a very sour note and I'd like to explain... Around 9:30 I bumped into Donn Bichsel Jr, whom I met at Mash-tun the week before at Bridgeport Arts Center. We chatted, exchanged business cards and briefly discussed an off-site meeting/party for work this summer. I mentioned to Donn that the event was great but I bought too many tickets and tried getting a t-shirt at 9:10 pm and they were already closed. His exact verbatim response: \"Do I look like Josh? Do I look like I have a handlebar mustache? DO I LOOK LIKE I CARE?!\" And he turned abruptly and walked away... Let me tell you, that was the worst ending possible as I stood there, jaw dropped in amazement and shock holding six tickets. I thought to myself you just lost a Revolution fan, a restaurant customer/patron a corporate event and \"you don't care.\" This is a gentleman representing your fine brewery and is the Director of Sales. Not exactly the best sales tactic I've seen.  I will hang on to the great memory of B.A. Baracus stout and the bad taste of Donn Bichsel's attitude in my mind...

My Aunt \" Linda Lopez\" is still alive but she is retired. She still helps run the company though. I remember being in my uncles home in Pilsen in the 1970's and he would ask me and my siblings if we were hungry? He would have my cousins or my Aunt call down to the restaurant that was on the first floor, and still is, and have them send up whatever amount of tacos.

I got the alambre. They have different versions and I was most interested in the one that closest resembled what I had in Mexico. That one was steak, onions, green peppers, bacon, and cheese (you basically add bacon and cheese to fajitas). At San Luis, they also add ham. That works for me, I happen to love ham. It came out sizzling on the pan and it was enough that I took around half home. It was very good stuff. I will be back soon. I have not heard of any other place in Chicago that serves this. I also got an al pastor taco cause I figured if they have alambre, they may have traditional al pastor tacos too. They give you option of cilantro and onions or lettuce, tomatoes, maybe something else like cheese? I got the onion and cilantro. It was good, but it didn't have pineapple. I have yet to find a restaurant in Chicago that does the pineapple on the al pastor tacos. If any of you out there know a place...send me a message. My wife got a steak sope and huevo con chorizo taco. She liked both, but really loved the sope. I took a bite and can confirm it was very delicious.  Other diners with us got a steak burrito, a milanesa torta, and a taco de lengua. They all liked them and I didn't try them, so not much to say on my part. The burrito looks like the traditional american burrito that I dislike. If I eat a burrito, it should be like a big taco (i.e. steak...cilantro...onions). I just don't like lettuce, tomatoes, and a two pounds of sour cream. I guess thats just my personal preference. The torta looked good. I hear the taco de lengua was delicious, but I don't eat that...
